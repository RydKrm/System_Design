Here’s a **comprehensive list of topics** for learning **Clean Code**, broken into well-structured categories. You can follow this like a curriculum or checklist.

---

## ✅ 1. **Foundations of Clean Code**

> Start here to build your mindset and core understanding.

* What is Clean Code?
* Why Clean Code Matters
* The Cost of Messy Code
* Characteristics of Clean Code

  * Readable
  * Simple
  * Expressive
  * Maintainable
  * Testable

---

## 🏷️ 2. **Naming Conventions**

> Good names = self-documenting code.

* Meaningful Names
* Pronounceable and Searchable Names
* Avoid Hungarian Notation
* Use Consistent Naming Patterns
* Avoid Ambiguous/Generic Names (e.g., `data`, `temp`)
* Use Domain Language (Ubiquitous Language in DDD)

---

## 🧱 3. **Functions**

> Functions are the heart of clean code.

* Functions Should Do One Thing
* Keep Functions Small
* Function Name Should Say What It Does
* Prefer Fewer Arguments (Max 3)
* Avoid Flag Arguments (e.g., `doSomething(true)`)
* Use Default Parameters Instead
* No Side Effects
* Extract Nested Logic into Sub-functions
* Command–Query Separation

---

## 🧱 4. **Classes and Objects**

> Encapsulate properly and keep responsibilities tight.

* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* Small, Focused Classes
* Use Cohesive Data Structures
* Avoid God Objects
* Favor Composition Over Inheritance
* Encapsulation: Keep Data Private
* Use Interfaces Properly

---

## 🔁 5. **Code Structure and Formatting**

> Clean layout helps readability.

* Consistent Indentation
* Logical File/Folder Structure
* Use Blank Lines for Separation
* Related Code Should Be Close Together
* Minimize Nested Code (Avoid Deep Nesting)
* Group Similar Code (e.g., private methods at bottom)
* Line Length Should Be Reasonable

---

## ♻️ 6. **DRY & Reusability**

> Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)

* Identify and Remove Duplication
* Use Reusable Utilities and Helpers
* Avoid Copy-Paste Programming
* Reuse via Functions/Classes/Modules

---

## 🧪 7. **Testing & Clean Code**

> Clean code is testable code.

* Write Unit Tests
* Understand TDD (Test-Driven Development)
* Use Descriptive Test Names
* Avoid Over-mocking
* Focus on Behavior Over Implementation
* Keep Tests Fast and Reliable

---

## ⚠️ 8. **Error Handling**

> Clean error handling is predictable and consistent.

* Don’t Ignore Errors
* Use Try/Catch/Finally or Error Wrappers
* Fail Fast, Log Clearly
* Provide Context in Error Messages
* Avoid Empty Catch Blocks
* Prefer Specific Errors Over Generic Ones

---

## 💬 9. **Comments and Documentation**

> Code should be readable without comments.

* Prefer Self-Explanatory Code Over Comments
* Use Comments for **Why**, not **What**
* Avoid Redundant Comments
* Use JSDoc/Docstrings for APIs
* Keep Comments Updated or Remove

---

## 🚩 10. **Code Smells**

> Identify and fix "bad" code patterns.

* Duplicated Code
* Long Functions
* Large Classes
* Long Parameter Lists
* Primitive Obsession
* Switch Statements Overuse
* Data Clumps
* Feature Envy
* Inappropriate Intimacy
* Speculative Generality

---

## 📦 11. **Modularization and Separation of Concerns**

> Organize logic cleanly.

* Break Logic Into Small Modules
* Follow SOLID Principles
* Separate UI, Business Logic, and Data
* Respect Boundaries Between Layers
* Avoid Mixing Concerns (e.g., DB logic in controllers)

---

## 📐 12. **SOLID Principles**

> Object-Oriented design principles for scalable, clean systems.

1. **S** - Single Responsibility Principle
2. **O** - Open/Closed Principle
3. **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle
4. **I** - Interface Segregation Principle
5. **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle

---

## 🧹 13. **Refactoring Techniques**

> How to clean existing code.

* Extract Function
* Inline Function
* Rename Variable
* Replace Magic Number with Named Constant
* Introduce Parameter Object
* Replace Conditional with Polymorphism
* Remove Dead Code
* Simplify Nested Conditionals

---

## 🧰 14. **Tools and Automation**

> Let tools help you maintain clean code.

* Linters (ESLint, Flake8, Golint, etc.)
* Formatters (Prettier, Black, gofmt)
* Static Analysis Tools (SonarQube, CodeClimate)
* Code Quality Metrics (Cyclomatic Complexity, Code Coverage)

---

## 📚 15. **Code Review Skills**

> Learn how to write and review code cleanly.

* How to Review Code for Cleanliness
* Giving Constructive Feedback
* Writing Better Pull Requests
* Documenting Design Decisions (ADR)

---

## 🧠 16. **Mindset and Culture**

> Clean code is a team habit.

* Take Responsibility for Code Quality
* Value Clarity Over Cleverness
* Make Clean Code a Habit, Not a Task
* Write Code for the Next Developer (even if it’s you)
