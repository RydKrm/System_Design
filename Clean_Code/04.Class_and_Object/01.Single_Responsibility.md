### **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** ‚Äî *Clean Code Standard*

---

## üîπ What is SRP?

> "**A class should have one and only one reason to change.**"
> ‚Äî Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)

This means:
Each **class**, **module**, or **function** should be responsible for **only one part of the functionality** of the system.

---

## üîπ In Terms of **Class**:

A **class** should encapsulate only **one responsibility**, or in other words, should **do only one job**.

### ‚úÖ Good Example:

```ts
class InvoicePrinter {
  print(invoice: Invoice) {
    // logic to print invoice
  }
}

class InvoiceSaver {
  save(invoice: Invoice) {
    // logic to save invoice to DB
  }
}

class Invoice {
  constructor(public items: Item[], public total: number) {}

  calculateTotal(): number {
    // calculate and return total
    return this.total;
  }
}
```

Each class has **one reason to change**:

* `Invoice`: change in business logic.
* `InvoicePrinter`: change in printing logic.
* `InvoiceSaver`: change in saving logic.

---

### ‚ùå Bad Example (violates SRP):

```ts
class Invoice {
  constructor(public items: Item[], public total: number) {}

  calculateTotal(): number {
    return this.total;
  }

  print(): void {
    // logic to print invoice
  }

  save(): void {
    // logic to save invoice to DB
  }
}
```

Here, `Invoice` is doing **three things**:

* Business logic (`calculateTotal`)
* Persistence (`save`)
* Presentation (`print`)

So, it has **multiple reasons to change** ‚Äî this **violates SRP**.

---

## üîπ In Terms of **Objects**:

An **object instance** should only represent one concept or **encapsulate one behavior**. Its methods and data should **align with a single purpose**.

If an object handles **multiple concerns**, it's a sign that your code needs to be refactored into smaller, more focused classes or components.

---

## üîπ Why SRP Matters in Clean Code

* ‚úÖ Makes code **easier to test**.
* ‚úÖ Promotes **readability and clarity**.
* ‚úÖ Encourages **separation of concerns**.
* ‚úÖ Leads to **modular** and **reusable** code.
* ‚úÖ Minimizes **side effects** when changing code.

## üß† Tip to Remember

> "If you need to explain **more than one responsibility** in the class name, or the class is getting too big ‚Äî it's time to **split it up**."

---
Great! Here's a **real-world SRP example from an e-commerce system** (like the one you're building):

---

## üõí Use Case: **Order Processing**

### ‚ùå Violates SRP: All-in-one `OrderService`

```ts
class OrderService {
  createOrder(orderData: any) {
    // validate order
    // calculate total
    // process payment
    // send confirmation email
    // save order to database
  }
}
```

### üî¥ Problem:

`OrderService` has **multiple responsibilities**:

1. Validation
2. Price calculation
3. Payment processing
4. Email sending
5. Database persistence

It has **many reasons to change**, violating SRP.

---

## ‚úÖ Follows SRP: Split into focused services

```ts
class OrderValidator {
  validate(orderData: any) {
    // validation logic
  }
}

class PriceCalculator {
  calculate(orderData: any): number {
    // calculate total price
    return 100;
  }
}

class PaymentProcessor {
  processPayment(orderData: any, amount: number) {
    // payment gateway logic
  }
}

class EmailService {
  sendOrderConfirmation(customerEmail: string) {
    // send confirmation email
  }
}

class OrderRepository {
  save(orderData: any) {
    // save to DB
  }
}

class OrderService {
  constructor(
    private validator: OrderValidator,
    private calculator: PriceCalculator,
    private payment: PaymentProcessor,
    private email: EmailService,
    private repository: OrderRepository,
  ) {}

  createOrder(orderData: any) {
    this.validator.validate(orderData);
    const total = this.calculator.calculate(orderData);
    this.payment.processPayment(orderData, total);
    this.repository.save(orderData);
    this.email.sendOrderConfirmation(orderData.customerEmail);
  }
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Now:

* Each class has **one responsibility**.
* `OrderService` becomes a **coordinator**, not a bloated logic holder.
* Easy to **test, extend, or replace** individual parts (e.g., change payment gateway).
