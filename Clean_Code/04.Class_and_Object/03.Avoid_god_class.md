## üí• What Is a God Object?

A **God Object** is a class or data structure that **knows too much** or **does too much**.

Think of it like this:

> ‚ÄúOne class that‚Äôs trying to be the king of everything.‚Äù

It controls:

* too many behaviors
* handles unrelated data
* and gets bigger and messier over time.

---

### üß† Why It‚Äôs a Problem

A God Object is like that one coworker who tries to do **everyone‚Äôs job** ‚Äî marketing, HR, tech, accounts ‚Äî and ends up doing **none of them well**.

* ‚ùå **Hard to maintain** ‚Äî any change might break multiple unrelated things.
* ‚ùå **Hard to test** ‚Äî because it touches too many areas.
* ‚ùå **Low cohesion** ‚Äî logic and data are not focused on a single purpose.
* ‚ùå **High coupling** ‚Äî everything depends on this one bloated piece.

## üîß Real-World Analogy: E-commerce System

### ‚ùå God Object Example (Bad Design)

```ts
class ECommerceSystem {
  // Customer Info
  customerName: string;
  customerEmail: string;

  // Product Info
  productList: any[];

  // Order Info
  orderId: string;
  paymentMethod: string;
  totalAmount: number;

  // Inventory Info
  stockLevels: Map<number, number>;

  // Methods for everything!
  placeOrder() { /*...*/ }
  updateStock() { /*...*/ }
  sendEmail() { /*...*/ }
  calculateDiscount() { /*...*/ }
  generateInvoice() { /*...*/ }
}
```

This class does **everything**:

* user management
* order handling
* inventory
* billing
* emailing

This is a **God Object**. It has 10+ responsibilities = 10+ reasons to break. üö´

## ‚úÖ How to Avoid God Objects

> **Break big classes into focused, smaller ones** ‚Äî each with a single purpose.

---

### ‚úÖ Refactored Example (Clean Design)

```ts
class Customer {
  constructor(public name: string, public email: string) {}
}

class Product {
  constructor(public id: number, public name: string, public price: number) {}
}

class InventoryService {
  updateStock(productId: number, quantity: number) {
    // logic to update stock
  }
}

class Order {
  constructor(public customer: Customer, public items: Product[], public total: number) {}
}

class PaymentService {
  processPayment(order: Order, method: string) {
    // logic to process payment
  }
}

class EmailService {
  sendOrderConfirmation(customer: Customer) {
    // logic to send email
  }
}
```

Each class has **one job**:

* `Customer`: handles customer data
* `Product`: represents a product
* `InventoryService`: handles stock updates
* `Order`: contains order logic
* `PaymentService`: handles payments
* `EmailService`: sends emails

Now, if one thing changes (like how we process payments), we only touch **one class**.

## üß† How to Apply This in Your Code

| Step | What To Do                                                          |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£  | Identify any **class/file with too many fields or methods**         |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£  | Ask: ‚ÄúDoes this class have more than one reason to change?‚Äù         |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£  | Split into **smaller, cohesive classes or services**                |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£  | Use **composition**, not massive inheritance                        |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£  | Name things clearly ‚Äî `PaymentService`, `Invoice`, `Customer`, etc. |

## üîÑ Anti-Pattern to Watch

Avoid this:

```ts
class ManagerService {
  // user logic
  // order logic
  // inventory logic
  // reporting logic
}
```

No class should be a **"Manager of everything"**. Refactor it into distinct services.

## ‚úÖ Clean Code Summary: Avoid God Objects

| ‚úÖ Do                    | ‚ùå Don‚Äôt                |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| One class = one purpose | One class = many jobs  |
| High cohesion           | Low cohesion           |
| Clear, testable units   | Big, tangled mess      |
| Modular structure       | Spaghetti dependencies |
