Here’s a **comprehensive list of rules/principles for keeping code clean in an Object-Oriented (OO) manner**, based on *Clean Code*, SOLID principles, and best practices:

---

### **1. General Code Cleanliness**
- **Follow the Boy Scout Rule**: "Leave the code cleaner than you found it."
- **Use Meaningful Names**: Variables, methods, and classes should reveal intent.
- **Keep Functions/Methods Small**: Do one thing (Single Responsibility Principle).
- **Avoid Deep Nesting**: Use guard clauses or early returns to flatten logic.
- **Write Minimal Comments**: Let the code explain itself (but document "why" when needed).

---

### **2. Object-Oriented Design Principles (SOLID)**
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subclasses should be substitutable for their parent class.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients shouldn’t depend on interfaces they don’t use.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions.

---

### **3. Class Design Rules**
- **Encapsulate Data**: Keep fields `private` and expose behavior via methods.
- **Favor Composition Over Inheritance**: Use delegation/interfaces instead of deep hierarchies.
- **Avoid God Classes**: Split monolithic classes into smaller, cohesive ones.
- **Immutable Objects**: Prefer immutable state where possible (thread-safe, predictable).
- **Law of Demeter (LoD)**: A method should only call:
  - Its own members.
  - Objects it creates.
  - Objects passed as parameters (avoid "train wrecks" like `obj.getA().getB().doSomething()`).

---

### **4. Method Design Rules**
- **Small and Focused**: 1 method = 1 responsibility (ideally < 10 lines).
- **Avoid Side Effects**: Methods should do what their name suggests (no hidden surprises).
- **Use Polymorphism**: Replace `switch`/`if-else` with strategy pattern or inheritance.
- **Command-Query Separation (CQS)**:
  - **Commands**: Perform actions (e.g., `void save()`).
  - **Queries**: Return data (e.g., `String getName()`).
  - Avoid mixing both (e.g., `boolean saveAndReturnStatus()` is bad).

---

### **5. Inheritance & Polymorphism**
- **Prefer Interfaces to Abstract Classes**: Supports multiple inheritance of type.
- **Avoid Deep Inheritance Trees**: Favor shallow hierarchies (1–2 levels).
- **Don’t Inherit for Code Reuse**: Use composition instead.
- **Override Methods Carefully**: Ensure substitutability (LSP).

---

### **6. Dependency Management**
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Pass dependencies explicitly (don’t `new` inside classes).
- **Avoid Static/Global State**: Hard to test and introduces hidden coupling.
- **Use Factories or Builders** for complex object creation.

---

### **7. Error Handling**
- **Don’t Return `null`**: Use `Optional` or throw exceptions.
- **Don’t Ignore Exceptions**: Handle or propagate them meaningfully.
- **Use Unchecked Exceptions for Bugs**: Checked exceptions for recoverable errors.

---

### **8. Testing & Maintainability**
- **Write Unit Tests**: Follow the FIRST principles (Fast, Isolated, Repeatable, Self-Validating, Timely).
- **Refactor Mercilessly**: Improve design incrementally.
- **Avoid Premature Optimization**: Focus on readability first.

---

### **Final Tip**
Apply these rules pragmatically—clean code balances **readability**, **maintainability**, and **flexibility**. When in doubt, ask:  
*"Will this make the code easier to understand and change later?"*
