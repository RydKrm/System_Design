The principle **"Favor Composition Over Inheritance"** is a key object-oriented design guideline emphasized in *Clean Code* and other software engineering best practices. It suggests that **composing objects (building functionality by combining smaller, independent components) is generally better than relying on deep inheritance hierarchies.**

### **Why?**
Inheritance creates a **tight coupling** between parent and child classes, leading to several problems:
1. **Fragile Base Class Problem** – Changes in the parent class can break child classes.
2. **Inflexible Hierarchy** – Inheritance forces an "is-a" relationship, which may not always be appropriate.
3. **Multiple Inheritance Issues** – Some languages don’t support it, leading to complex workarounds.
4. **Overly Deep Hierarchies** – Can make code harder to understand and maintain.

### **Composition: A Better Alternative**
Composition means **building objects by referencing other objects** (via interfaces or dependencies) rather than inheriting behavior. This promotes:
- **Loose Coupling** – Components can be swapped or modified independently.
- **Greater Flexibility** – Objects can change behavior at runtime (e.g., using Dependency Injection).
- **Better Reusability** – Small, focused classes can be reused in different contexts.
- **Avoids Hierarchy Explosion** – No need to create endless subclasses for minor variations.

### **Example: Inheritance vs. Composition**
#### **Inheritance Approach (Problematic)**
```java
class Duck {
    void quack() { System.out.println("Quack!"); }
    void swim() { System.out.println("Swimming!"); }
    void display() { System.out.println("Generic duck"); }
}

class RubberDuck extends Duck {
    @Override
    void quack() { System.out.println("Squeak!"); } // Override
    @Override
    void display() { System.out.println("Yellow rubber duck"); }
}
```
**Problem:** What if we need a `RobotDuck` that doesn’t swim? Inheritance forces unwanted behavior.

#### **Composition Approach (Better)**
```java
interface Quackable { void quack(); }
interface Swimmable { void swim(); }
interface Displayable { void display(); }

class DefaultQuack implements Quackable {
    public void quack() { System.out.println("Quack!"); }
}

class SqueakQuack implements Quackable {
    public void quack() { System.out.println("Squeak!"); }
}

class Duck {
    private final Quackable quacker;
    private final Swimmable swimmer;
    private final Displayable displayer;

    Duck(Quackable q, Swimmable s, Displayable d) {
        this.quacker = q;
        this.swimmer = s;
        this.displayer = d;
    }

    void quack() { quacker.quack(); }
    void swim() { swimmer.swim(); }
    void display() { displayer.display(); }
}

// Usage:
Duck rubberDuck = new Duck(new SqueakQuack(), new DefaultSwim(), new RubberDisplay());
```
**Advantages:**
- **No forced behavior** – `RobotDuck` can omit `Swimmable`.
- **Runtime flexibility** – Change `quack()` behavior dynamically.
- **Easier testing** – Mock dependencies easily.

### **When to Use Inheritance?**
Inheritance is still useful when:
- There’s a **true "is-a" relationship** (e.g., `Dog` is an `Animal`).
- You need **polymorphism** with shared base behavior.
- The hierarchy is **stable and unlikely to change**.

### **Conclusion**
- **Prefer Composition** for flexibility, maintainability, and avoiding tight coupling.
- **Use Inheritance Sparingly** when you truly need an "is-a" relationship with shared behavior.

This principle aligns with **SOLID** principles, particularly:
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** – Small, focused classes.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** – Extend via composition, not modification.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** – Depend on abstractions, not concretions.
