### üß© Clean Code Principle: **Use Cohesive Data Structures**

---

## üîç What Does It Mean?

> **Cohesive data structures** are tightly related and grouped around a single concept or purpose.

In **clean code**, this means:

* Structs, classes, objects, and DTOs should group only data that **belongs together**.
* Avoid "God" objects or unrelated fields lumped into one structure.
* High **cohesion** = better **readability**, **maintainability**, and **reusability**.

---

## ‚úÖ Good (Cohesive) Example: E-commerce Checkout

```ts
// Customer Info
class Customer {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  address: Address;
}

// Address Info
class Address {
  street: string;
  city: string;
  country: string;
}

// Payment Info
class PaymentDetails {
  method: 'CARD' | 'CASH' | 'PAYPAL';
  transactionId: string;
}

// Order Info
class Order {
  customer: Customer;
  items: OrderItem[];
  payment: PaymentDetails;
  totalAmount: number;
}
```

### üß† Why it's clean:

* `Customer`, `PaymentDetails`, and `Address` are each **focused**.
* All fields in each class **belong to one concern**.
* Easy to reason, test, and reuse.

---

## ‚ùå Bad (Non-cohesive) Example:

```ts
class OrderData {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  street: string;
  city: string;
  method: string;
  transactionId: string;
  items: any[];
  totalAmount: number;
}
```

### üî¥ Problem:

* This mixes **customer info**, **address**, **payment**, and **order** data in one flat object.
* Low cohesion: many unrelated fields live together.
* Harder to **extend**, **test**, or **reuse** this structure.

## üéØ How to Apply This in Real Projects

| Principle              | How to Apply                                                                |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Group related fields | into classes or nested types (e.g., `address`, `payment`, `meta`)           |
| ‚úÖ Use composition      | to build complex structures from simple, cohesive ones                      |
| ‚úÖ Use DTOs or schemas  | that match the exact purpose (e.g., `CreateOrderDto`, `CustomerProfileDto`) |
| ‚ùå Don‚Äôt lump all data  | into one big, unstructured object                                           |

## üîß In a NestJS DTO (Example)

```ts
export class AddressDto {
  @IsString()
  street: string;

  @IsString()
  city: string;
}

export class PaymentDto {
  @IsEnum(['CARD', 'CASH'])
  method: string;

  @IsString()
  transactionId: string;
}

export class CreateOrderDto {
  @ValidateNested()
  customer: CustomerDto;

  @ValidateNested()
  payment: PaymentDto;

  @ValidateNested()
  address: AddressDto;

  @IsArray()
  items: OrderItemDto[];
}
```

---

## üìå Summary

* **Cohesive data** = everything in the structure belongs to a **single, focused idea**.
* Improves **clarity, testing, reuse**, and **change safety**.
* Think in **small, meaningful units**, not **big general containers**.

#### Here's a **brief real-world example** of using **cohesive data structures** in an e-commerce context:

---

### ‚ùå Bad (Non-cohesive):

```ts
// Too many unrelated fields in one structure
const order = {
  name: "Riyad",
  email: "riyad@example.com",
  street: "123 Main St",
  city: "Dhaka",
  method: "CARD",
  transactionId: "TXN123456",
  items: [{ productId: 1, qty: 2 }],
  total: 500
};
```

üî¥ Problem:

* Customer info, address, payment, and order items are all mixed together.
* Low cohesion = harder to manage, validate, and reuse.

---

### ‚úÖ Good (Cohesive):

```ts
const order = {
  customer: {
    name: "Riyad",
    email: "riyad@example.com"
  },
  address: {
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Dhaka"
  },
  payment: {
    method: "CARD",
    transactionId: "TXN123456"
  },
  items: [
    { productId: 1, qty: 2 }
  ],
  total: 500
};
```

‚úÖ Now:

* `customer`, `address`, `payment`, and `items` are grouped by concern.
* Clear, organized, easier to validate or extend (e.g., add shipping method).

---

This is a clean, **cohesive** structure ‚Äî each group of data serves a **single responsibility**.
