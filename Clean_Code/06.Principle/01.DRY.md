### **DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)**  
**Definition:** Avoid duplicating code by reusing logic via functions, classes, or modules.  

**Why?**  
- Reduces errors (fix once, not everywhere).  
- Easier maintenance (changes in one place).  
- Cleaner, more readable code.  

**Example:**  
❌ **Bad (Repeated Code):**  
```python
# Calculating area in multiple places
circle_area = 3.14 * radius * radius  
cylinder_volume = 3.14 * radius * radius * height  
```

✅ **Good (DRY - Single Source of Truth):**  
```python
def calculate_area(radius):
    return 3.14 * radius * radius

circle_area = calculate_area(radius)  
cylinder_volume = calculate_area(radius) * height  
```

**Key Takeaway:**  
**"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous representation in the system."**  
→ Extract repeated logic into reusable components (functions, constants, classes).
