### **What is Clean Code?**  
**Clean code** is code that is **easy to read, understand, and maintain**. It follows best practices in software development, emphasizing:  

- **Clarity** – The code should be self-explanatory, with meaningful names and a logical structure.  
- **Simplicity** – Avoid unnecessary complexity; do one thing well per function/module.  
- **Consistency** – Follow a uniform style (naming, formatting, patterns).  
- **Maintainability** – Code should be easy to modify and extend without introducing bugs.  
- **Efficiency** – Optimized for performance where necessary, but not at the cost of readability.  

### **Why Clean Code Matters**  
1. **Readability** → Developers spend more time reading code than writing it. Clean code reduces cognitive load.  
2. **Maintainability** → Easier to fix bugs, add features, and refactor.  
3. **Collaboration** → Teams work more efficiently when code is understandable by others.  
4. **Reduced Bugs** → Well-structured code minimizes hidden errors and unintended side effects.  
5. **Long-Term Cost Savings** → Bad code slows development over time, leading to "technical debt."
