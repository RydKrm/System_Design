### 1. What is a Pipeline Job?

* A **Pipeline Job** in Jenkins is a job type that defines your **entire build, test, and deploy process as code**.
* Instead of clicking around the Jenkins UI to configure steps (like in freestyle jobs), you write a script (usually called a **Jenkinsfile**) that lives in your source code repository.
* This makes your CI/CD process **version-controlled, repeatable, and sharable**.

In short: Pipeline = "Your project’s build logic written as code."

### 2. Two Flavors of Pipeline

Jenkins gives you two ways:

1. **Declarative Pipeline** – A higher-level, opinionated syntax. Cleaner, easier for most teams.
   Example:

   ```groovy
   pipeline {
       agent any
       stages {
           stage('Build') {
               steps {
                   echo "Building the app..."
               }
           }
           stage('Test') {
               steps {
                   echo "Running tests..."
               }
           }
           stage('Deploy') {
               steps {
                   echo "Deploying to server..."
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   * Easier to read and maintain.
   * Enforces a standard structure (`pipeline { }`, `stages`, `steps`).

2. **Scripted Pipeline** – Full control with raw Groovy script.
   Example:

   ```groovy
   node {
       stage('Build') {
           echo "Building..."
       }
       stage('Test') {
           echo "Testing..."
       }
       stage('Deploy') {
           echo "Deploying..."
       }
   }
   ```

   * More flexible, but harder to manage at scale.
   * Mostly used by advanced users or when declarative syntax can’t handle edge cases.

### 3. Core Building Blocks

* **Agent** → Defines *where* the pipeline runs (Jenkins node/agent).
  Example: `agent any` runs on any available node.
* **Stages** → Logical groups of tasks (Build, Test, Deploy).
* **Steps** → The actual commands inside each stage (`sh`, `echo`, `script`, etc).
* **Post** → Actions after the pipeline (e.g., `always`, `success`, `failure` blocks).

  ```groovy
  post {
      success { echo "Pipeline succeeded!" }
      failure { echo "Pipeline failed!" }
  }
  ```

### 4. Features That Make Pipeline Jobs Powerful

1. **Pipeline as Code** – Lives with your repo, easy to version and review.
2. **Durability** – Survives Jenkins restarts or crashes; pipeline can resume.
3. **Parallelism** – Run stages in parallel. Example:

   ```groovy
   stage('Tests') {
       parallel {
           stage('Unit Tests') {
               steps { echo "Unit tests..." }
           }
           stage('Integration Tests') {
               steps { echo "Integration tests..." }
           }
       }
   }
   ```
4. **Human Interaction** – Pause pipeline for approval with `input` step.
5. **Extensibility** – Works with plugins (Docker, Kubernetes, Slack, GitHub, etc.).
6. **Visualization** – Blue Ocean plugin shows nice UI of pipeline flow.

### 5. Jenkinsfile Workflow (Typical)

1. Developer commits code → pushes to GitHub.
2. Jenkins is triggered (via webhook or polling).
3. Jenkins reads the **Jenkinsfile** from the repo.
4. Runs the stages (Build → Test → Deploy).
5. Reports results (console logs, artifacts, test results).

---

### 6. Example: Realistic Pipeline

Let’s say you have a Node.js app. Your Jenkinsfile could look like this:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        NODE_ENV = 'production'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/your-repo.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Install') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm test'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm run build'
                archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'dist/**', fingerprint: true
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'scp -r dist/* user@server:/var/www/app'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            echo 'Pipeline finished'
        }
        failure {
            mail to: 'team@example.com',
                 subject: "Build Failed: ${env.JOB_NAME} #${env.BUILD_NUMBER}",
                 body: "Check Jenkins for details."
        }
    }
}
```

### 7. Why Teams Prefer Pipeline Jobs Over Freestyle Jobs

* **Consistency**: Same pipeline everywhere; no "lost settings" in Jenkins UI.
* **Version Control**: Any developer can update build steps via PR.
* **Scalability**: Works well for microservices and big projects.
* **Automation**: Integrates tightly with Docker, Kubernetes, cloud deploys.

So, to put it plainly:
**Freestyle job = clicking buttons in Jenkins UI.**
**Pipeline job = writing a script that defines the entire CI/CD lifecycle, stored in your repo.**
