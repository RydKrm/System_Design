# Rust Learning Roadmap for Backend Development

Congratulations on starting your Rust journey! Here's a comprehensive learning path tailored for backend development:

## Phase 1: Fundamentals (Weeks 1-3)

**Getting Started**

- Installing Rust and Cargo (the package manager)
- Understanding the Rust toolchain (rustc, cargo, rustup)
- Your first "Hello, World!" program
- Cargo basics: creating projects, building, and running

**Core Language Basics**

- Variables and mutability (let, mut)
- Data types: integers, floats, booleans, characters, strings
- Functions and return values
- Comments and documentation
- Control flow: if/else, loops (loop, while, for)
- Pattern matching basics

**Ownership System** (This is crucial and unique to Rust)

- Ownership rules and the stack vs heap
- Move semantics
- Borrowing and references (&T and &mut T)
- Slices
- The Copy trait vs Clone trait

## Phase 2: Intermediate Concepts (Weeks 4-6)

**Data Structures**

- Structs and methods (impl blocks)
- Enums and pattern matching
- Option and Result types (error handling the Rust way)
- Vectors, HashMaps, and other collections
- Strings vs &str (understanding string types)

**Error Handling**

- Result and Option in depth
- The ? operator for error propagation
- Custom error types
- panic! vs recoverable errors
- Error handling best practices

**Traits and Generics**

- Defining and implementing traits
- Generic types and functions
- Trait bounds
- Common standard library traits (Debug, Clone, Copy, Display)
- Iterators and iterator adapters

**Modules and Crates**

- Module system and visibility (pub, private)
- Using external crates from crates.io
- Creating your own libraries
- Workspace organization

## Phase 3: Advanced Rust (Weeks 7-9)

**Lifetimes**

- Lifetime annotations
- Lifetime elision rules
- Static lifetimes
- Lifetimes in structs and methods

**Smart Pointers**

- Box<T> for heap allocation
- Rc<T> and Arc<T> for reference counting
- RefCell<T> and interior mutability
- Understanding when to use each

**Concurrency**

- Threads and thread safety
- Send and Sync traits
- Mutex and RwLock
- Channels for message passing
- Async/await basics
- Tokio or async-std runtime

**Advanced Traits**

- Associated types
- Trait objects and dynamic dispatch
- Operator overloading
- From/Into traits for conversions

## Phase 4: Backend-Specific Skills (Weeks 10-14)

**Web Frameworks**

- Choose one to start: Axum, Actix-web, or Rocket
- Routing and handlers
- Middleware
- Request/response handling
- JSON serialization with Serde
- Form handling and validation

**Database Integration**

- Diesel (ORM) or SQLx (async SQL)
- Connection pooling
- Migrations
- CRUD operations
- Transactions
- Query builders

**REST API Development**

- Designing RESTful endpoints
- Request validation
- Error responses and status codes
- API documentation with tools like utoipa
- Testing APIs

**Authentication & Authorization**

- JWT tokens
- Session management
- Password hashing (bcrypt, argon2)
- OAuth integration
- Role-based access control

## Phase 5: Production-Ready Skills (Weeks 15-18)

**Async Programming Deep Dive**

- Understanding async/await thoroughly
- Futures and Streams
- Tokio runtime in depth
- Async traits and patterns
- Handling concurrent requests

**Testing**

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Mocking with mockall or similar
- Test-driven development (TDD)
- Property-based testing with proptest

**Logging and Monitoring**

- tracing and tracing-subscriber
- Structured logging
- Metrics collection
- Error tracking
- Performance profiling

**Deployment and DevOps**

- Building release binaries
- Docker containerization
- Environment configuration
- CI/CD pipelines
- Performance optimization
- Memory management and profiling

## Phase 6: Advanced Backend Topics (Ongoing)

**Advanced Patterns**

- Microservices architecture
- gRPC with tonic
- GraphQL with async-graphql
- WebSockets for real-time features
- Message queues (RabbitMQ, Redis)
- Caching strategies (Redis)

**Security**

- SQL injection prevention
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- Input sanitization
- Security headers
- Audit dependencies with cargo-audit

**Performance Optimization**

- Benchmarking with criterion
- Profiling tools (flamegraph, perf)
- Memory optimization
- Database query optimization
- Load testing

**Advanced Rust Concepts**

- Macros (declarative and procedural)
- Unsafe Rust (when necessary)
- FFI (Foreign Function Interface)
- Zero-cost abstractions understanding
- Type-driven design

## Practical Learning Tips

**Practice Projects** (Build these in order):

1. CLI todo app
2. Simple REST API with in-memory storage
3. Blog API with database
4. Authentication service
5. Real-time chat application
6. E-commerce backend
7. Your own project idea

**Daily Habits**:

- Read The Rust Book (official documentation)
- Solve problems on Exercism or LeetCode in Rust
- Read other people's Rust code on GitHub
- Participate in Rust forums and communities
- Build something every week

**Resources**:

- The Rust Programming Language book (free online)
- Rust by Example
- Rustlings exercises
- Zero To Production In Rust (backend-focused book)
- Official Rust documentation
