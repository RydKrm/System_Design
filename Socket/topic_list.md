# **1. Basics of Sockets**

Before coding, you need to understand what sockets are and how they work.

**Topics to learn:**
* What is a socket?
* How networks work: TCP/IP basics
* Difference between **TCP** and **UDP**
* Ports and IP addresses
* Client-server model
* Blocking vs Non-blocking sockets

**Practical exercises:**
* Learn to open a socket connection using your language of choice (Node.js, Python, or Go)
* Write a simple client-server program that sends and receives text messages

---

## **2. Programming Sockets (Beginner Level)**

Learn how to implement socket communication in code.

**Topics to learn:**
* Creating a TCP client and server
* Creating a UDP client and server
* Sending and receiving messages
* Handling errors
* Closing connections properly

**Practical exercises:**    
* Simple chat application
* File transfer between client and server
* Experiment with both TCP and UDP

---

## **3. Intermediate Socket Concepts**

Now you dive deeper into handling multiple connections and efficiency.

**Topics to learn:**
* Concurrent connections
* Threads, processes, or async handling
* Non-blocking sockets
* Select, poll, epoll, or kqueue (depending on your OS)
* Socket options and configuration (e.g., timeout, buffer size)
* Keep-alive, heartbeats, and connection management
* Understanding latency, throughput, and network performance

**Practical exercises:**
* Multi-client chat server
* Broadcast messages to all connected clients
* Handle disconnects and reconnections gracefully

---

## **4. Advanced Sockets / Real-time Communication**

Move from raw sockets to building scalable, real-time systems.

**Topics to learn:**
* WebSockets
  * Difference from TCP sockets
  * Handshake and protocol upgrade
* Socket.io (if using Node.js) or equivalent libraries
* Event-driven architectures
* Message framing and binary protocols
* Security
  * SSL/TLS encryption
  * Authentication (JWT, API keys)
* Load balancing socket connections
* Heartbeat and reconnection strategies
* Rate limiting and flood protection

**Practical exercises:**
* Real-time chat app with rooms/channels
* Multiplayer game server basics
* Real-time notifications system

---

## **5. Very Advanced / Distributed Sockets**

Once you are comfortable, move toward production-ready scalable systems.

**Topics to learn:**
* Scaling socket servers horizontally
  * Redis Pub/Sub for multi-instance communication
  * NATS, Kafka for messaging
* High-performance socket programming
  * ZeroMQ
  * Netty (Java), libuv (C/C++/Node.js)
* Protocols over sockets
  * Custom binary protocols
  * gRPC streams
* Monitoring and debugging connections
  * Wireshark
  * tcpdump
* Performance tuning and benchmarking

**Practical exercises:**
* Build a scalable notification or chat microservice
* Integrate socket servers with REST/GraphQL APIs
* Streaming real-time data (stock prices, IoT data, live feeds)

### **Suggested Learning Path**
1. Learn the theory (TCP/IP, UDP, client-server)
2. Implement simple TCP and UDP sockets
3. Handle multiple clients with async/non-blocking sockets
4. Learn WebSockets for real-time applications
5. Build full-featured real-time apps
6. Scale to multi-instance, distributed socket systems
