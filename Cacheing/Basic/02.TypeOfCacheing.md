## ðŸ“˜ Chapter: Types of Caching â€“ Where and How Data Is Stored Temporarily

Caching is a foundational technique in system design, used to store frequently accessed data in a faster, more accessible location. However, caching can be implemented in **different layers** of a system, each with its own purpose, performance benefits, and trade-offs.

This section explores the most common **types of caching**: **in-memory, disk-based, CDN, browser, and database-level caching**â€”briefly and clearly.

### ðŸ”¹ 1. In-Memory Cache

**What it is**:
Stores data in **RAM**, typically using tools like **Redis** or **Memcached**.

**Use case**:
Great for **low-latency**, high-throughput applications. Commonly used to cache API responses, session data, or frequently accessed objects.

**Benefits**:

* Extremely fast (microsecond access)
* Reduces load on databases

**Limitation**:

* Volatile (data is lost on restart)
* Limited by available RAM

> ðŸ“˜ Example: An e-commerce app caches product details in Redis for faster page load.

### ðŸ”¹ 2. CDN Cache (Edge Cache)

**What it is**:
A **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** caches static content (images, JS, CSS, videos) at **edge servers close to users**.

**Use case**:
Speeds up delivery of static assets and reduces origin server load.

**Benefits**:

* Low latency globally
* Reduces bandwidth and server costs

**Limitation**:

* Best for static content, not dynamic data

> ðŸ“˜ Example: A global news site uses Cloudflare CDN to cache images and videos near the reader's location.

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Disk-Based Cache

**What it is**:
Stores cached data on **local disk or SSD**, often used when RAM is too expensive or small.

**Use case**:
Suitable for large data sets, media files, or when cache persistence across reboots is important.

**Benefits**:

* Larger capacity than RAM
* Can persist across restarts

**Limitation**:

* Slower than in-memory
* More I/O overhead

> ðŸ“˜ Example: A desktop app caches thumbnails or user files on disk to reduce network calls.

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Browser Cache

**What it is**:
Modern browsers cache static resources like HTML, CSS, JS, and images locally on the user's machine.

**Use case**:
Improves frontend performance and reduces server requests.

**Benefits**:

* Instant page loads for repeat visits
* Reduces network usage

**Limitation**:

* Managed by browser rules (expiration, eviction)
* Not suitable for sensitive or dynamic data

> ðŸ“˜ Example: A user visits a website; on the second visit, most files load instantly from the browser cache.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. Database Cache

**What it is**:
Caching results of expensive or frequently used **queries inside the database engine** (e.g., PostgreSQL query planner, MySQL buffer pool) or externally (e.g., materialized views).

**Use case**:
Speeds up repeated query execution or joins in relational/NoSQL databases.

**Benefits**:

* Faster query response time
* Reduces database CPU load

**Limitation**:

* Needs careful invalidation strategy
* Can add complexity

> ðŸ“˜ Example: A blog platform uses materialized views to cache recent post listings instead of recalculating every time.

### ðŸ“Œ Summary Table

| Type      | Speed | Scope        | Best Use                     |
| --------- | ----- | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| In-Memory | âš¡âš¡âš¡   | App/backend  | API responses, sessions      |
| CDN       | âš¡âš¡    | Global users | Static assets (images, CSS)  |
| Disk      | âš¡     | Local system | Large files, offline caching |
| Browser   | âš¡âš¡    | Client-side  | Web resources                |
| Database  | âš¡âš¡    | DB layer     | Repeated query results       |

### âœ… Conclusion

Each type of caching solves a specific problem in the data access lifecycle. In-memory cache maximizes speed, CDN and browser cache optimize delivery, disk cache offers persistence, and database caches reduce query overhead. **Understanding when and where to use each type** is key to building fast and scalable systems.
