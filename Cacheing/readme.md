## 🚀 Caching Roadmap for Backend Developers

### 📘 Stage 1: **Beginner – Core Concepts (Weeks 1–2)**

> ✅ Goal: Understand what caching is and why it matters.

#### ✅ Topics:

* What is caching?
* Why caching improves performance (latency, scalability, cost).
* Difference between memory and persistent storage.
* Types of caching (in-memory, CDN, disk, browser, DB).
* Cache-hit vs cache-miss.
* TTL (Time-to-Live), eviction policies (LRU, LFU, FIFO).

#### ✅ Practice:

* Cache data in memory using:

  * `Node-cache` (Node.js)
  * `GoCache` (Golang)
* Add simple in-memory cache to a function (e.g., expensive DB query or API call).

---

### 🧠 Stage 2: **Intermediate – Backend Data Caching (Weeks 3–4)**

> ✅ Goal: Learn how to apply caching to your backend code.

#### ✅ Topics:

* Where to cache: API responses, database queries, business logic.
* Read-through, write-through, write-behind, and cache-aside patterns.
* Setting cache keys and structure (naming strategy).
* TTL and invalidation strategies.
* Serialization and compression of cached objects.

#### ✅ Tools to Learn:

* **Redis** (main focus)

  * Data types: string, hash, list, set, sorted set
  * TTL, keys, basic Redis CLI
  * Redis client in your language (e.g., `ioredis`, `go-redis`, etc.)

#### ✅ Practice:

* Use Redis to cache:

  * API responses
  * Frequently accessed DB queries
  * User sessions or tokens

---

### ⚙️ Stage 3: **Advanced – Scalable and Smart Caching (Weeks 5–7)**

> ✅ Goal: Use caching for large-scale, distributed systems.

#### ✅ Topics:

* Cache consistency (how to avoid stale data)
* Distributed caching strategies
* Redis clustering and replication
* Pub/Sub for cache invalidation
* Using caching with microservices
* Preventing cache stampede, avalanche, penetration
* Horizontal scaling, cache warm-up strategies

#### ✅ Tools:

* Redis Sentinel (high availability)
* Redis Cluster
* Redis Streams or Pub/Sub
* Optional: **Memcached** as alternative

#### ✅ Practice:

* Invalidate cache automatically after data updates
* Use a distributed Redis setup
* Handle cache fallback (misses gracefully)
* Use Redis Pub/Sub to sync cache between services

---

### 💡 Stage 4: **Expert – Real-world Optimization & Observability (Weeks 8–10)**

> ✅ Goal: Optimize, monitor, and build fault-tolerant caching systems.

#### ✅ Topics:

* Monitoring cache hit/miss ratio
* Logging and observability (e.g., Prometheus + Grafana)
* Custom caching middleware
* Smart pre-caching (cache warming)
* Caching partial responses / GraphQL resolver-level caching
* CDN + API caching combo
* Fault-tolerant caching (what happens if Redis goes down?)

#### ✅ Tools:

* Redis with monitoring dashboard (RedisInsight, Grafana)
* Application metrics with Prometheus
* CDN cache headers (`Cache-Control`, `ETag`, etc.)
* Reverse proxies (e.g., Varnish, Nginx caching)

#### ✅ Practice:

* Build a dashboard to observe Redis usage
* Simulate Redis failure and fallback
* Use Redis for rate limiting and deduplication
