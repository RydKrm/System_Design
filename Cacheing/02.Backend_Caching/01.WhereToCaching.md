**Chapter: Where to Cache**

When we talk about caching, the first question isn’t *how* to cache — it’s *what* and *where* to cache.
Caching is like keeping shortcuts in your brain: you don’t want to memorize *everything*, only the things you’ll need often and quickly. In software, the same principle applies.

Let’s break it down into the three most common layers where caching makes sense.

### **1. API Responses**

Imagine your backend API is like a waiter in a busy restaurant. If every customer asks the same “What’s today’s soup?” question, and the waiter runs to the kitchen each time, service slows down.
Instead, the waiter can just remember the answer for the day.

API response caching works exactly like that. If many users are requesting the same data — say, product details or trending news — you can store that result in a cache and serve it instantly.

* **When to do it:** For data that changes infrequently (seconds to minutes, not milliseconds).
* **Benefits:** Drastically reduces server load and speeds up response time.
* **Caution:** Be careful with highly dynamic or user-specific data — you don’t want to show Alice’s bank balance to Bob.

### **2. Database Queries**

Your database is powerful, but it’s also a resource hog when asked to repeat heavy queries.
If your app runs the same query hundreds of times a minute (like “top 10 most popular posts”), the database is doing unnecessary work.
By caching the result in memory (Redis, Memcached), you avoid hitting the database for repeated requests.

* **When to do it:** For expensive queries, aggregated results, or frequently accessed rows.
* **Benefits:** Reduces database load, improves throughput, and can delay costly scaling.
* **Caution:** Cached data must be kept in sync when the underlying data changes.

### **3. Business Logic Results**

Not all slow computations come from APIs or databases — sometimes the bottleneck is your own logic.
Maybe you have a pricing algorithm that crunches hundreds of rules or a machine learning model that takes seconds to process input.
Caching the *result* of that computation can make your application feel instant.

* **When to do it:** For CPU-intensive or repetitive computations that return the same result for given inputs.
* **Benefits:** Saves processing time and reduces infrastructure cost.
* **Caution:** If your inputs change frequently, cached results might become stale quickly.

**The Key Takeaway:**
Before choosing a caching tool or strategy, always ask yourself: *Where is my application spending the most time repeating work?*
That’s your first candidate for caching. Caching is not a magic wand — it’s a scalpel. Used wisely, it removes performance bottlenecks without cutting into correctness.
