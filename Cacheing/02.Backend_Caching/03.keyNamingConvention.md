## **Setting Cache Keys & Structure (Naming Strategy)**

### **Concept**

A **cache key** is the unique identifier your cache uses to store and retrieve a piece of data â€” think of it like a variable name in a giant shared dictionary.
A good naming strategy ensures keys are:

* **Unique** â€” no accidental overwriting of unrelated data.
* **Predictable** â€” developers know exactly how to find or update the right data.
* **Scalable** â€” works well even as your app grows and your caching needs expand.

Poorly designed keys lead to mysterious bugs, stale data, and wasted cache space.

---

### **Why It Matters**

* Prevents **key collisions** (two different data items overwriting each other).
* Makes **invalidation easier** (you can delete related keys with predictable patterns).
* Improves **debugging** (a key name should tell you whatâ€™s inside without guessing).

---

### **How to Structure Cache Keys**

#### **1. Use Namespaces (Prefixing)**

Break your cache into logical sections using prefixes.
Format:

```
<app>:<feature>:<id>
```

Example:

```
shop:product:123
shop:cart:user456
```

* **Benefit:** Easy to group and clear related items (e.g., `DEL shop:product:*`).

---

#### **2. Include Identifiers**

If the cached data is tied to a specific user, product, or resource, always include its unique ID in the key.
Example:

```
crm:invoice:2024-INV-789
profile:user:101
```

---

#### **3. Add Versioning**

When you change your data format, you can avoid stale cache issues by versioning keys.
Example:

```
news:v2:top_headlines
```

* **Benefit:** Old cache keys will naturally expire and not conflict with new format.

---

#### **4. Keep Keys Short but Descriptive**

* Redis and Memcached store keys in memory, so extremely long keys waste RAM.
* Still, they should be descriptive enough to understand at a glance.

---

#### **5. Consistent Delimiters**

Pick one delimiter (commonly `:` or `|`) and stick to it. This makes patterns easier to search and maintain.

---

### **Example Scenario**

Letâ€™s say youâ€™re building a **multitenant SaaS CRM** with caching:

| Data              | Cache Key                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| User profile      | `crm:user:101`             |
| Organization info | `crm:org:500`              |
| Userâ€™s invoices   | `crm:invoice:user:101`     |
| Dashboard stats   | `crm:v3:dashboard:org:500` |

Now if you want to invalidate all invoices for a user:

```
DEL crm:invoice:user:101
```

Or all cache for an organization:

```
DEL crm:*:org:500
```

---

### **Pros of Good Naming Strategy**

* Easier maintenance.
* Faster troubleshooting.
* Safer bulk invalidations.

### **Cons of Poor Naming Strategy**

* Accidental overwrites.
* Difficulty in finding related keys.
* Risk of stale or incorrect data being served.

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:**
If youâ€™re using Redis in production, combine good naming with a **Time-To-Live (TTL)** so unused keys eventually expire â€” even if you forget to delete them.
